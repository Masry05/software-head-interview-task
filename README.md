# Software Head Interview Task

This repository contains a deliberately messy fullstack app (React + Node.js) designed as a 2-hour refactoring and design exercise.

- Candidate README is at `Candidate-README.md`.
- Solutions/guide is at `Solutions-Guide.md`.

Folders:
- `server/` — Node.js Express backend with poor practices
- `client/` — React app with poor practices

Timebox: ~2 hours for a mid-level engineer.
